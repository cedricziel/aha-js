 * Aha! REST API
 * API for interacting with Aha! product management platform.  ## Rate Limiting The API enforces rate limits to ensure fair usage: - **300 requests per minute** per account - **20 requests per second** per account  When rate limits are exceeded, the API returns a `429 Too Many Requests` response with a `retry_after` header indicating when to retry.  ## Authentication The API supports two authentication methods: - **OAuth 2.0**: For web applications and integrations requiring user consent - **API Tokens**: For server-to-server integrations and personal access  ## Request Headers - **User-Agent**: Required header to identify the client application - **Content-Type**: Set to `application/json` for POST/PUT requests - **Authorization**: Bearer token or OAuth access token  ## Response Format All responses are in JSON format. List endpoints include pagination metadata in the `meta.pagination` object.  ## Error Handling The API uses standard HTTP status codes and includes detailed error messages in the response body for debugging.
